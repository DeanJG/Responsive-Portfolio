        <p id="pgraph1">Well this is my attempt at a website. I can be a bit shy at first, but once I've gotten comfortable I do my best to be vocal when sensible. I work best with deadlines as I can occasionally be a bit of a procrastinator, but with a deadline I always make sure the work gets done in time. Recently I've gotten better about piece-mealing the work so that even if I don't necessarily have anything officially started, I know more or less what I need and how to find everything I don't have to get the job done.</p>
        <p id="pgraph2">Between varied work environments and receiving a BA in Psychology, I've practiced human analysis, sales, customer interaction in the service industry, inventory control, and now web development.</p>
        <p id="pgraph3">Altogether these skills add up to a formidable ability to handle and organize a multitude of data, and the interpersonal nature of conveying these data both within the workplace and without.</p>
